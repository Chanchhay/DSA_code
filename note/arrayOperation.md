## Array Operations
- operation means to access, update, search, sort ... the way we work with the array


- Access by index -> O(1)
```
int value[] = {11,22,44};
cout << value[0] << endl; // constant time O(1)
```
- Traverse -> O(n)
`loop to print array`
- Bubble sort O(n^2)

- Search (unsorted array) O(n)
- Search (sorted array) O(log n)
