# THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURE
1. **Linear DS**


#### Time complixity
Time : for N input, how much time does it take to execute the code?
#### Space complixity
Memory :  for N input, how much memory (ram) it uses ?

Assymnotic Notations
1. Big O Notation: Worst-case senario
2. Omega Notation: Best-case senario
3. Theta Notation: Average

Big O -> describe both (time and space complixity)

## Review Array
### Array is collection of elements of the same data type stored in a contiguous memory locations.
It is one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.

#### Key notes
1. Homogeneous: all elements must be of the same type
2. Fixed size: size is determined at a compile time (for static array)
3. Contiguous memory : elements are stored in adjacent memory location.
4. Index-Based Access : element accessing indices (0-based in c++)
5. Random Access: O(1) time complexity for accessing any element.

## Types of Arrays
### There are three types of Arrays in C++
1. Static Array(Stack-Allocated)
> Fixed size
- number of element is determine at compile-time
- Static ( StackOverFlow )
