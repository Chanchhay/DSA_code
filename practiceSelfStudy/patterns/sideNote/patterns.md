## Patterns is important before getting into DSA
### Loops is also a things that we need to master
**Any patterns will have innner loop and outer loop**
1. for the outer loop count the number of line
2. for the inner loop, focus on the columns and connect them somehow to the rows
3. print them ("*" "a" "b" ...) inside the for loop
4. observe symetry (optional)
